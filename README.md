## RU Hacks

## AngelHacks 2.0 

*02/26/2021  - 02/28/2021*

### Summarify

Summarify is a dual-interface application, with user experience ingrained in both the frontend as a web app and the backend as a console app. Users can simply text, such as notes from class, by simply pasting, choosing a summarization algorithm, submitting the text, and copying back the displayed shorter text from the web app. The user can do the same but also specify specific multiple .txt, .docx, or .pdf files in one go using the console app.

## BrickHack7

*Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)*

*02/20/2021  - 02/21/2021*

### DocVR

*Best COVID-19 Hack*

Using Unity Game Engine and Google DialogFlow, DocVR allows patients to seek advice from a virtual reality doctor trained with common phrases in clinical settings. I personally worked on logging the doctor's speech into a CockroachDB distributed database, with topic sorting capabilities using NLP algorithms from NLTK.

## EconHacks 2021

*02/13/2021  - 02/14/2021*

### TournamentMaster

*4th Place*

With flexible applications from college admissions to job hiring to contract selection, TTournamentMaster presents a backend Solidity script that can systematically winnow out participants in a tournament-like style. The whole structure is based on the tournament tree data structure. Adding realism and customizability, the backend engineer who uses the script can specify which attributes of participants to compare in a match and the number of winners at the end. This is a solo effort.

## SwampHacks VII

*University of Florida (UF)*

*01/29/2021  - 01/31/2021*

### Sentinel

*InfoTech Challenge: Most innovative use of a public dataset for the public good*

Sentinel uses data collected online to create a visual heatmap of the severity of issues across the globe. This allows users to see a visual representation of disparities or needs. I created embedded CSV-to-JSON conversion ability by uploading user-provided csv files directly on the website. This facilitates storing the data in the backend Cloud Firestore database I have set up.
